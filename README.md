# NES Emulator

I have some trouble understanding how the NES hardware
(and specially cartridges) works, so I'm building an
as-simple-as-I-can emulator to really get it (I'm that dumb)
in java 11 (because reasons).

### What's working so far?
- I can kinda load iNES rom file format

### What I'm working on right now?
- Load a single cart (Tetris) data onto memory check for CHR RAM/ROM presence
