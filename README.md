# NES Emulator

I have some trouble understanding how the NES hardware
(and specially cartridges) works, so I'm building an as-simple-as-I-can emulator to really get it (I'm that dumb)
in java 11 (because reasons).

### What's working so far?

- I can kinda load iNES rom file format into memory

### What I'm working on right now?

- Making a very initial version of CPU with a (literal) couple of instructions

### Parking lot

- Check for CHR RAM/ROM presence
- Proper logging
